As robots become more common in our daily lives, there has been an increase in research on human-robot interaction. To enable more human-like interaction with robots, automatic gesture recognition systems are available and can replace traditional human-machine interactive devices such as keyboards, mouse, joysticks, etc.  Hand gestures can make our lives and the lives of differently abled persons easier. It can be applied to virtual environments, robotics, home automation, clinical operations, game control, desktop/tablet applications, delivery service, sign language and more. 

Drones are widely used in most of these applications. They are commonly used for sports event coverage, ariel photography and quickly transporting equipment to emergency areas.  Drones are remotely controlled robots operated via a remote control device or smartphone. Developing automatic systems that can recognize hand gestures would greatly improve the ability to interact with drones intuitively, with a very low likelihood of errors. The drone should be able to recognize specific human gestures and respond accordingly.Our goal is to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system for human-drone interaction.
