Special thanks also to my supervisor, doc. Ing. MSc. Martin Klauƒço, PhD., for his guidance, patience, and feedback throughout my thesis journey. 
I appreciate the support from my peers, who provided the encouragement needed to harness the madness of our journey, particularly in moments when the world is a scary place.
Lastly, thanks to all my friends and family, for the times I found myself looking at my own reflection to recognize that something profound is slowly changing in me.
