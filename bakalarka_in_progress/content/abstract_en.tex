This project focuses on identifying gestures using a drone's camera and controlling the drone based on these gestures. Our target area is to create a reliable system for gesture recognition and drone control without the need for creating complex mathematical models.

Our work includes using the drone's camera to capture gestures and identifying these gestures using the MediaPipe library. We aim to recognize various gestures, including those that control drone movements such as ascents, descents, rotations, and taking photographs. For identification, we have implemented a neural network model that we trained on a dataset containing various hand gestures. In conjunction with the OpenCV library for image processing, the model is capable of recognizing and classifying gestures in real-time based on footage from the drone's camera.

Our work has enabled us to successfully identify various gestures and control the drone based on these recognized gestures. The project also demonstrates how gesture recognition can be a practical and interesting method for interacting with drones, allowing people to intuitively control these devices.
